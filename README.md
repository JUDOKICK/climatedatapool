# ClimateDataPool
**Decentralized storage and file management for climate data**

The Paris Climate Accord was a momentous accomplishment, uniting all the world's nations in an effort to tackle climate change. ClimateDataPool intends to unite the reporting of all the nations on a blockchain.

Our objective with this project is to build an IPFS/Filecoin-based file management app for collecting and sharing climate data.
