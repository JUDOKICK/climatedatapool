# ClimateDataPool
**Decentralized storage and file management for climate data**

The Paris Climate Accord was a momentous accomplishment, uniting all the world's nations in an effort to tackle climate change. ClimateDataPool intends to unite the reporting of the nations on a blockchain.

Our objective with this project is to build a running Proof of Concept of an IPFS-based file management app for climate data.
